# DocWatcher
DocWatcher â€“ "The silent guardian of your documents."  A smart AI-powered system that monitors, retrieves, and delivers knowledge from your documents using LangChain, Qdrant, and RAG. 


## ðŸš€ Project Context

This project was developed as a **technical proof-of-concept** ahead of the MIMESTIS project at Institut Mines-TÃ©lÃ©com Saint-Ã‰tienne.

> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Validate the feasibility of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, OpenAI, and Qdrant for intelligent document-based mentorship.

This pre-version demonstrated:
- Document ingestion + embedding
- Vector search via Qdrant
- Query handling with a basic chatbot interface

The success of this prototype led to the development of a full-scale implementation in the [MIMESTIS project](#) (link coming soon).
